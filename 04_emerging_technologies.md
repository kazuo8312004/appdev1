# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## What is AI?
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. These systems can perform tasks such as recognizing patterns, understanding language, solving problems, and adapting to new information. AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>

## What is the purpose of AI?
<p>The primary purpose of Artificial Intelligence is to automate complex tasks, improve decision-making, and enhance efficiency across various domains. In education, AI personalizes learning experiences and supports teachers with intelligent tools. In the IT industry, AI powers data analysis, cybersecurity, and intelligent automation.

AI systems are designed to process massive amounts of data, identify trends, and make predictions. This leads to smarter systems that can adapt to user behavior, optimize operations, and reduce human error. Ultimately, AI aims to augment human capabilities and transform how we interact with technology.</p>
